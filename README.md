## 1. Introdution
This is an implementation of calculating the factorial of the digits' sum in a given date. This project can be used to associate dates with numbers to help construct a hash function. 

<a name="req"></a>
## 2. Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher.
- *Datetime* v4.3 or higher.

<a name="inst"></a>
## 3. Installation
- Download the desired python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Clone this repository. 
- Install the *Datetime* library using the command `pip install datetime`.

<a name="use"></a>
## 4. Usage 
To run the project, use the following command `python3 /path_to_file/main.py` in the cmd. 
You will be prompted to enter a date of the format `DD/MM/YYYY` in the console. After entering the date, the script will calculate the result as explained in the introduction. The script will handle any errors that result from using incorrect formats.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
